### :pushpin: What is this?
This app is the result of a 2.5 day hackathon, part of the Codaisseur Code Academy.
We were challenged to create an app around the at randomly selected theme :fire:STRESS:fire:. The goal of the challange was to also use a technology we had never used before.
I chose to make a mobile app with React Native.

### :pushpin: Description & Intention
What I chose to do to step up to the 2.5 day "stress" challenge was to build my first ever mobile app
using React Native, as my new technology. For the actual content, I decided to instead of opting for "stress relieving" , to go the other way and make an app that would be "stress inducing".
I also wanted the app to be interactive with some sort of game element.
The final result of all this is the "Dude, chill..." app.
Curious? Check out the result [here](https://expo.io/@jetskevdwouden/dude_chill_0).

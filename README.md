## :pushpin: What is this?
This app is the result of a 2,5 day hackathon, part of the Codaisseur Code Academy.
We were challenged to create an app around the at randomly selected theme :fire:STRESS:fire:. The goal of the challange was to also use a technology we had never used before.
I chose to make a mobile app with React Native.

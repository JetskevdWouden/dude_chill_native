# dude_chill_native
*Most Recent*  "Dude, chill.." is a React Native mobile app. A game to test your sensitivity to stress. 

The result of a 2,5 day hackathon part of the Codaisseur Code Academy. 
We were challenged to make an app around the theme "Stress" using a technology we had never used before.
I chose to make a mobile app with React Native. 
Check out the deployed version [here](https://expo.io/@jetskevdwouden/dude_chill_) on expo.

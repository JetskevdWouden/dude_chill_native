## :information_desk_person: O-M-G, what is this?
This app is the result of a 2,5 day hackathon, part of the Codaisseur Code Academy.
We were challenged to make an app around the at randomly selected theme :fire:STRESS:fire:. The goal of the challange ws also to use a technology we had never used before to create an app.
I chose to make a mobile app with React Native.
